    p=&x; // Pointer p points to x
   *p=10;// Dereference p to set the value of x to 10
    // The value of x is now 10
   p=&z[1]; // Pointer p now points to the second element of z
   *(&z[0]+1)+=3; // Increment the second element of z by 3
    printf("%d %d %d\n",x,z[0],z[1]);   // Print the values of x, z[0], and z[1]
    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful execution

// Output: 10 10 14
// Explanation: The code initializes an integer x and an array z with two elements. It uses a pointer p to manipulate the values of x and z. The pointer p is first set to point to x, then it modifies the value of x to 10. Next, p is set to point to the second element of z, and the second element of z is incremented by 3. Finally, the program prints the values of x, z[0], and z[1], resulting in the output "10 10 14".
// Note: The code contains a few errors, such as using uppercase 'P' instead of lowercase 'p' for the pointer variable.
